# Solution Architecture

## O\*NET Data

### Overview

O\*NET Data is sourced from a variety of sources, including analytics, interviews of incumbents, and surveys.

The data is then modeled into the [O\*NET Content Model](https://www.onetcenter.org/content.html), which pivots around the Standard Occupational Classification (SOC) code.

#### Standard Occupational Classification

SOCs are organized in a hierarchy of jobs based on the similarity of the work activities they perform. Taking the SOC for Data Scientists (15-2051), that hierarchy looks like this;

```         
15-0000  Computer and Mathematical Occupations   
    15-2000  Mathematical Science Occupations
        15-2040  Statisticians
            15-2041  Statisticians 
        15-2050  Data Scientists
            15-2051  Data Scientists 
                15-2051.00  Data Scientists 
                15-2051.01  Business Intelligence Analysts
                15-2051.02  Clinical Data Managers
```

For our purposes we will consider all occupations under the 15-2051 and 15-2041 SOCs as our scope.

#### Abilities

The Abilities data links SOCs with Abilities, such as "Reading Comprehension". These are broad categorizations of fundamental capabilities relevant to an occupation. The are rated by **Importance**, meaning how critical the ability is to performing the job, and **Level**, or the degree of expertise needed to perform the job.Both are rated from 0 to 6, with 6 being the most important or relevant.

#### Work Activities

Work activities describe the actual things that are done to get the job done, such as "Getting Information". Work activities are also the way that SOCs are organized and categorized. They are again rated by Level and Importance.

#### Alternate Titles

These are titles that O\*NET recognizes to be related to a given SOC. This is helpful to join or define occupations outside of the O\*NET data model.

| column_name     | type                   | column_content                                   |

| alternate_title | Character Varying(250) | Alternate occupational title                     |
| short_title     | Character Varying(150) | Short version of alternate title (if applicable) |
| sources         | Character Varying(50)  | List of source codes â€” see below                 |

#### Education, Experience, and Training

O\*NET also maps data on relevant education and training to a given SOC. The `category` is ranked from 1-11 for all of education, experience, and training, with 11 being equivalent to 10+ years of experience and a Professional / Post-Master's level of education, and 1 representing no experience and less than a high school degree.

See the [Education, Training, and Experience Categories](https://www.onetcenter.org/dictionary/29.0/text/ete_categories.html) for full details.

#### Skills

O\*NET skills are generalized and can be learned or taught. This is in contrast to Abilities which are considered more "innate".

Skills are rated by Level and Importance.

#### Technology Skills

Technology skills refer to experience or ability with a specific set of technology tools, from Atlassian's Jira to Apache Airflow.

They are not quantitatively ranked per occupation, but are flagged as "In demand" or "Hot technology" to indicate their qualitative relevance.

## LinkedIn Course Data

LinkedIn Learning is a skill development platform that offers online professional development courses.  Many of these courses fall under data science related topics. These topics include Artificial Intelligence Foundations, Generative AI, Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing nlp, Neural Networks and Deep Learning, Data Analysis, Data Visualization, Business Intelligence, Tech Career Skills, Data Engineering, Database Development, Database Administration, Data Resource Management, and Data Centers.  Summary course data was retrieved via a webscraper, which navigated to the course catalog for each topic and compiled a csv file of links to each course.  Course info was then retrieved and parsed, with the following data collected.

| column name                    | data type 		| column content                                                                                                            |

## Stackoverflow Job Data

Every year Stack Overflow conducts a survey of users of their products. This survey recruits respondents through various outreach channels including blog posts, onsite ads, and social media posts and is considered on of the best sources of information on tech jobs and trends due to the high engagement of tech workers with their products. The public survey results for all years the survey has been conducted can be found [here](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/).

The survey covers a wide range of topics dealing with the developer experience and technological developments but the fields we are interested in deal largely with the technologies that developers work with. By connecting the technologies used to the adjusted salaries of specific categories of respondents we can get an idea of what technical skills are considered most valuable for data scientists. Additionally, we can use fields dealing with collaboration and communication tools as proxies for certain soft skills. A breakdown of the fields taken from the raw data can be found below.
