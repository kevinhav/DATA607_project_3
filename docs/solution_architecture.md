# Solution Architecture

## O\*NET Data

### Overview

O\*NET Data is sourced from a variety of sources, including analytics, interviews of incumbents, and surveys.

The data is then modeled into the [O\*NET Content Model](https://www.onetcenter.org/content.html), which pivots around the Standard Occupational Classification (SOC) code.

#### Standard Occupational Classification

SOCs are organized in a hierarchy of jobs based on the similarity of the work activities they perform. Taking the SOC for Data Scientists (15-2051), that hierarchy looks like this;

```         
15-0000  Computer and Mathematical Occupations   
    15-2000  Mathematical Science Occupations
        15-2040  Statisticians
            15-2041  Statisticians 
        15-2050  Data Scientists
            15-2051  Data Scientists 
                15-2051.00  Data Scientists 
                15-2051.01  Business Intelligence Analysts
                15-2051.02  Clinical Data Managers
```

For our purposes we will consider all occupations under the 15-2051 and 15-2041 SOCs as our scope.

#### Abilities

The Abilities data links SOCs with Abilities, such as "Reading Comprehension". These are broad categorizations of fundamental capabilities relevant to an occupation. The are rated by **Importance**, meaning how critical the ability is to performing the job, and **Level**, or the degree of expertise needed to perform the job.Both are rated from 0 to 6, with 6 being the most important or relevant.

#### Work Activities

Work activities describe the actual things that are done to get the job done, such as "Getting Information". Work activities are also the way that SOCs are organized and categorized. They are again rated by Level and Importance.

#### Alternate Titles

These are titles that O\*NET recognizes to be related to a given SOC. This is helpful to join or define occupations outside of the O\*NET data model.

| column_name     | type                   | column_content                                   |
|------------------|------------------|-----------------------------------|
| o_net_soc_code  | Character(10)          | O\*NET-SOC Code (see Occupation Data)            |
| alternate_title | Character Varying(250) | Alternate occupational title                     |
| short_title     | Character Varying(150) | Short version of alternate title (if applicable) |
| sources         | Character Varying(50)  | List of source codes â€” see below                 |
| soc_name        | Character              | Title of SOC                                     |

#### Education, Experience, and Training

O\*NET also maps data on relevant education and training to a given SOC. The `category` is ranked from 1-11 for all of education, experience, and training, with 11 being equivalent to 10+ years of experience and a Professional / Post-Master's level of education, and 1 representing no experience and less than a high school degree.

See the [Education, Training, and Experience Categories](https://www.onetcenter.org/dictionary/29.0/text/ete_categories.html) for full details.

#### Knowledge

Knowledge refers to domain knowledge, such as "telecommunications". It is again ranked per occupation by Level and Importance.

#### Skills

O\*NET skills are generalized and can be learned or taught. This is in contrast to Abilities which are considered more "innate".

Skills are rated by Level and Importance.

#### Technology Skills

Technology skills refer to experience or ability with a specific set of technology tools, from Atlassian's Jira to Apache Airflow.

They are not quantitatively ranked per occupation, but are flagged as "In demand" or "Hot technology" to indicate their qualitative relevance.
