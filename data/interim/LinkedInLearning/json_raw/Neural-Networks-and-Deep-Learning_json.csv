It is great that, should the viewer choose to follow along or download the code, they will be left with a very general neural network Python class that they can use to continue exploring NN and ML applications. I often found the practical challenges tricky, at least in part because of the abrupt introduction of new concepts and particular way of solving them - something everyone should do following this course is go through the functions for themselves and re-write them more efficiently (if possible) and/or in a way that makes more sense to them. The \""segment display recognition\"" exercises and demonstrations at the end are quite illuminating, and even more visualizations can be made on one's own (such as tracking the evolution of one-hot outputs for a given input) to visualize an even greater variety of NN behaviors!
