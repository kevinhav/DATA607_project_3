introduction to Variation AutoEncoders in 4h, this course is not it, unfortunately. While Axel admittedly is trying his best, instead of learning the general ideas and then practicing VAEs on a range of applications, the listener learns to explain one specific notebook. A lot of custom code choices are made in the notebook about the model structure, but are not explained in the course. After finishing, the listener keeps wondering which of the details can be changed without any effect and which would break it. Several smaller drawbacks:\n- none of the models are properly trained. Despite not being a live session, no final model result is shown that would be distinguishable from a random sequence. This sometimes reaches absurdity when the shown Denoising example returns texts completely unrelated to the original.\n- the information density of the video is low\n- Incorrect video is uploaded as a recap of what was covered\nCannot recommend."",""datePublished"":""2024-08-02T18:02:54.791Z"",""publisher"":{""@type"":""Organization"",""name"":""LinkedIn""},""bestRating"":5,""worstRating"":1}],""video"":{""@type"":""VideoObject"",""name"":""Leveling up in generative NLP - Generative NLP with Variational AutoEncoders"",""author"":{""@type"":""Person"",""name"":""Axel Sirota"",""description"":""Founder at Data Trainers LLC | Founder @ AI Training LLC | Microsoft Certified Trainer | AI and Cloud Consultant | Instructor | Author"",""jobTitle"":""Founder at Data Trainers LLC | Founder @ AI Training LLC | Microsoft Certified Trainer | AI and Cloud Consultant | Instructor | Author"",""url"":""https://ar.linkedin.com/in/axel-sirota-282383114"",""image"":""https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/C4E03AQEejFE4ITqQqw/profile-displayphoto-shrink_400_400/profile-displayphoto-shrink_400_400/0/1579981408450?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=Prk_XTVh2YFH39IYjlFoD00Gr_rvduA1oKofA-5P4Xo""},""thumbnailUrl"":""https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4E0DAQHT12O6oBOncQ/learning-public-crop_675_1200/learning-public-crop_675_1200/0/1719008965826?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=PekXgqPcbn-q97B2xArDuZisSavlSlDacKzxheOTHCo"",""description"":""Get an overview of variational autoencoders (VAEs) specifically focused on creating complex models in Keras, creating denoising autencoders, and creating VAEs for text generation."",""duration"":""PT46S"",""datePublished"":""2024-06-07"",""uploadDate"":""2024-06-07"",""requiresSubscription"":false,""isAccessibleForFree"":true,""contentUrl"":""https://www.linkedin.com/learning/generative-nlp-with-variational-autoencoders/leveling-up-in-generative-nlp""},""educationalLevel"":""Intermediate"",""educationalCredentialAwarded"":[{""@type"":""EducationalOccupationalCredential"",""name"":""LinkedIn Learning Certificate of Completion"",""url"":""https://www.linkedin.com/help/learning/answer/a598944/learning-certificates-of-completion-faqs"",""credentialCategory"":""Certificate"",""offers"":[{""@type"":""Offer"",""category"":""Subscription""}]}]}"
